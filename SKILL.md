# Cognitive HTML Effectiveness

Generate self-contained HTML files that people actually read — not walls of markdown they skim and ignore.

## When to use

This skill fires when the user asks for any of:

- "crea un reporte", "haz un status", "post-mortem", "incident report"
- "compara approaches", "tradeoffs", "qué opción es mejor"
- "explícame cómo funciona X", "recorrido del código", "walkthrough"
- "slides", "presentación", "deck", "demo"
- "diagrama", "flujo", "flowchart", "arquitectura"
- "prototipo", "animación", "transición"
- "design system", "colores", "tipografía", "componentes"
- "tablero", "triage", "kanban", "drag and drop"
- "revisa este PR", "analiza este diff"
- Or any request where the user would benefit from visual layout, color coding, interaction, or progressive disclosure instead of linear text.

## Core principles

These are non-negotiable. Every HTML file you produce must respect them.

| # | Principle | What it means |
|---|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | **Self-contained** | Zero external dependencies. All CSS in `<style>`, all JS in `<script>`, all SVG inline. The file opens directly in any browser — no server, no build step, no CDN. |
| 2 | **TL;DR first** | The most important information occupies the first viewport. Use a TL;DR box, summary band, or executive summary. Answer "what happened" or "what this is" before anything else. |
| 3 | **Progressive disclosure** | Show the big picture first, hide details behind collapsible sections, tabs, or scroll. The reader should never feel overwhelmed. |
| 4 | **Color has meaning** | Warm colors (clay, rust) = attention, warning, danger. Cool colors (olive) = success, safety, good. Grays = structure, metadata, neutral. Never use color as the ONLY signal — always pair with text or shape. |
| 5 | **Typography hierarchy** | Serif for headings (authority), sans for body (readability), mono for code and metadata. At least three levels of visual hierarchy on every page. |
| 6 | **Review empathy** | Design for the person who will read this Monday morning. They're busy, they're scanning, they need to know if this matters to them in 5 seconds. |
| 7 | **Export always** | Every interactive page ends with a button that exports the final state as markdown, JSON, or plain text. The artifact must leave the page. |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Detect palette

Read `references/palette-override.md` for the full protocol. In short:

1. Check if `AGENTS.md` exists in the project root.
2. Look for the block delimited by `<!-- cognitive-html:palette -->` and `<!-- /cognitive-html:palette -->`.
3. If found, parse the YAML inside. Merge overrides with defaults.
4. If not found, use the full default palette from `assets/design-tokens.css`.

### Step 2: Choose pattern

Read `references/decision-tree.md` for the full table. Match the user's request to one of the 10 patterns:

| Pattern | File | For... |
|---------|------|--------|
| Comparison | `patterns/comparison.md` | Side-by-side tradeoff analysis |
| Walkthrough | `patterns/walkthrough.md` | Code flow, architecture tour |
| Review | `patterns/review.md` | Annotated diff, PR analysis |
| Design System | `patterns/design-system.md` | Colors, typography, spacing tokens |
| Prototyping | `patterns/prototyping.md` | Animation sandbox, clickable flow |
| Diagram | `patterns/diagram.md` | Flowchart, architecture diagram |
| Deck | `patterns/deck.md` | Slide presentation |
| Explainer | `patterns/explainer.md` | Feature explanation, concept teaching |
| Report | `patterns/report.md` | Status update, post-mortem |
| Editor | `patterns/editor.md` | Interactive board, triage, drag-drop |

### Step 3: Read the pattern file

Each pattern file in `references/patterns/` contains:
- **When to use** — signal phrases that match this pattern
- **Structure blueprint** — the exact HTML skeleton
- **Component prescriptions** — which components from `references/components.md` to use
- **Full worked example** — a complete, self-contained HTML file you can study

### Step 4: Compose from components

Build the page using the component catalog in `references/components.md`. Do not invent new component patterns unless absolutely necessary. The catalog has 15 proven components: TL;DR box, summary band, tradeoff table, chips, timeline, collapsible snippets, code panels, tabs, callouts, action items, data tables, progress bars, decision cards, FAQ, and sidebar navigation.

### Step 5: Apply quality checklist

Before delivering, run through `references/quality-checklist.md`. Every item is a gate:
- Self-contained? Opens in any browser? Responsive?
- Language matches the prompt?
- TL;DR visible in first viewport?
- Palette respected (no hardcoded colors)?
- Interactive? → has export button?

### Step 6: Deliver

Return the HTML file. The filename should be descriptive and kebab-case (e.g., `incident-report-sync-502.html`, `comparison-debounce-approaches.html`). If the user asked for multiple things, generate one file per pattern — each self-contained.

## Language rule

**Detect the language of the user's prompt and generate ALL visible text in that same language.** This includes: headings, labels, descriptions, TL;DR content, button text, captions, tooltips, alt text, chart labels, placeholder text, and navigation labels.

Code, file paths, technical identifiers, CSS class names, and variable names remain in English.

Example:
- Prompt in Spanish → "Informe de incidente", "Línea de tiempo", "Elementos de acción"
- Prompt in English → "Incident Report", "Timeline", "Action Items"
- Prompt in Portuguese → "Relatório de incidente", "Linha do tempo", "Itens de ação"

## File naming

Generated HTML files use descriptive kebab-case names in the language of the content:

- `informe-incidente-502.html`
- `comparacion-enfoques-busqueda.html`
- `status-engineering-semana-11.html`
- `como-funciona-rate-limiting.html`

Place files in the current working directory unless the user specifies otherwise.

## The default palette

These are the default design tokens. They define the visual identity. Every generated file embeds them in a `<style>` block. Reference components by semantic variable name, never by raw hex value.

```
--ivory:    #FAF9F5   ← page background
--slate:    #141413   ← primary text
--clay:     #D97757   ← accent, warnings
--oat:      #E3DACC   ← secondary surfaces
--olive:    #788C5D   ← success, positive
--rust:     #B04A3F   ← danger, high severity
--gray-100: #F0EEE6   ← subtle backgrounds
--gray-300: #D1CFC5   ← borders
--gray-500: #87867F   ← secondary text
--gray-700: #3D3D3A   ← body text
--white:    #FFFFFF   ← card backgrounds
--serif: ui-serif, Georgia, serif
--sans:  system-ui, sans-serif
--mono:  ui-monospace, monospace
```

## Anti-patterns

- **Do NOT** link to external CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind CDN, etc.). The file must work offline.
- **Do NOT** use external JavaScript libraries. If you need interaction, write vanilla JS.
- **Do NOT** generate markdown files with "HTML-like" formatting. The output must be valid HTML.
- **Do NOT** use inline styles (`style="..."` attributes). All styles go in the `<style>` block.
- **Do NOT** hardcode hex colors. Always use CSS variables from the palette.
- **Do NOT** skip the TL;DR. Every page needs a "why should I care" signal at the top.
- **Do NOT** create pages without an export mechanism if they are interactive.
- **Do NOT** mix multiple patterns in one file unless the pattern explicitly supports it (e.g., report pattern can include a timeline). When in doubt, one file per intent.

## Reference files

This skill uses progressive disclosure. Read reference files only as needed:

- `references/decision-tree.md` — full pattern selection guide with examples
- `references/components.md` — catalog of 15 reusable UI components with HTML + CSS
- `references/palette-override.md` — how to customize colors per project via AGENTS.md
- `references/quality-checklist.md` — pre-delivery validation checklist
- `references/patterns/*.md` — one file per pattern, each with structure blueprint + worked example

When you need a specific pattern, read that one file — not all of them. When you need a component, reference `components.md` — do not guess the CSS.
