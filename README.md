# cognitive-html-effectiveness

> A skill for AI agents that generates self-contained, beautiful HTML documents — replacing walls of markdown with pages people actually read.

[![skills.sh](https://skills.sh/b/luisdamora/cognitive-html-effectiveness)](https://skills.sh/luisdamora/cognitive-html-effectiveness)

## What it does

This skill teaches AI agents to produce rich HTML outputs instead of linear markdown for developer-facing documents. It combines **cognitive documentation design** principles (progressive disclosure, chunking, signposting) with **10 battle-tested patterns** from the [Unreasonable Effectiveness of HTML](https://thariqs.github.io/html-effectiveness/) collection.

The agent generates a single `.html` file that:
- Opens directly in any browser — no server, no build step, no dependencies
- Uses a warm, professional design system with semantic color coding
- Shows the TL;DR first, details behind collapsible sections
- Exports back to markdown when interactive

## Install

```bash
npx skills add luisdamora/cognitive-html-effectiveness
```

Works with OpenCode, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and other AI coding agents.

## What agents learn to build

| Pattern | When the user asks... | Example |
|---------|-----------------------|---------|
| **Comparison** | "compara approaches", "tradeoffs" | Side-by-side code with pros/cons table |
| **Walkthrough** | "explícame cómo funciona X" | Flow diagram + numbered steps with code |
| **Review** | "revisa este PR" | Annotated diff + severity tags |
| **Explainer** | "cómo funciona rate limiting" | Collapsible steps + tabs + FAQ |
| **Report** | "reporte semanal", "post-mortem" | Summary band + chart + timeline |
| **Deck** | "slides para la demo" | Arrow-key slides, no Keynote needed |
| **Diagram** | "dibuja el pipeline" | SVG flowchart with clickable nodes |
| **Editor** | "tablero de triage" | Drag-drop board + export to markdown |
| **Design System** | "muéstrame los colores" | Color swatches + type scale |
| **Prototyping** | "prototipo de animación" | Animation sandbox with sliders |

## Customize colors

Add this block to your project's `AGENTS.md` to override the default palette:

```markdown
<!-- cognitive-html:palette -->
```yaml
ivory: "#FEFEFE"
slate: "#1A1A2E"
clay:  "#E94560"
olive: "#0F3460"
oat:   "#E8E8E8"
```
<!-- /cognitive-html:palette -->
```

## Language support

The agent detects the prompt language and generates all visible text in that language — English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and more.

## Based on

The 10 patterns are derived from the [HTML Effectiveness](https://thariqs.github.io/html-effectiveness/) collection by the Claude Code team — 20 self-contained HTML files demonstrating what agents can produce when they think in HTML instead of markdown.
